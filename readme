Hello this is my metal gear rex project, i have made this with a model but i won't release that, instead you can have the base already wired up

Some information, Green cube is jaw bone, Blue is top of the head, cube below them is the bottom of the head bone, which is connected to the Green cube

The cubes at the back top are for the missiles

Controls:

WASD to move
Shift to run
Control toggles crouch/duck
Alt toggles third person

F opens/closes mouth
Mouse2 toggles aim mode

Mouse1 to fire weapon
R switches weapon

For the miniguns you just hold the fire button,
for the missiles you hold the fire button to place targets where you aim, release to fire, 8 locks/missiles at once is max

Requires SProps and Wiremod
and some expression 2 extensions

That's all

Hello this is my metal gear rex project, i have made this with a model but i won't release that, instead you can have the base already wired up

Some information, Green cube is jaw bone, Blue is top of the head, cube below them is the bottom of the head bone, which is connected to the Green cube

The cubes at the back top are for the missiles

That's all
